Essential questions: 
# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? #
To interpret user needs is to think like the user. You need to be able to put yourself in their shoes. User stories are one aspect of this venture that helps with this. Obtaining direct requirements and needs from real users helps you to narrow down what they expect from your work, and how your work impacts them. After all, you can only do so much in terms of meeting expectations by yourself. Keeping a steady and meaningful line of communication between yourself and the client is an essential part of Scrum-Agile.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? #
The approach to developing programs is something that every successful team needs to have down to a science. As a developer, you need to approach developing programs as a step-by-step process and ensure nothing is lost among any members of the team, whether that be specific work that needs to be done, who needs to do that work, and when the work is expected to be shipped. Everything should be accounted for. Some important agile processes I look to incorporate into my future work are standup meetings, and product backlogs or worklogs. These processes allow team members to remain on the same page about the work, and remain on track with their assigned work as well as maintaining communication either in person or remotely.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? #
To be a good team member in software development entails many qualities. First, you must be open to learning every day. One of the cornerstones of life I always advocate for is the quote, "The day you stop learning is the day you die." and I am in firm belief that this especially has a place in software. Team members all have things to learn from each other, and the ideas thrown around, especially criticisms, need to be taken lightly and accomodatingly.
